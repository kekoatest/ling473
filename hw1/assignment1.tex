HW 3

\section*{Question 1}
\noindent
Prior to applying to CLMS, my experience had been in translation and localization. During my work in these fields, I realized that the industries depended entirely upon the technology that is standard in localization workflows. My current opinion is that there will be a $\approx$ 95 \% decrease in translation work due to automation within my lifetime. My original career goal was to contribute to that decrease as much as possible, but now I see that there is even more demand for NLPers in the fields of speech recognition and virtual assistants. I consider all the doors to be open to me, but there is much work ahead. 

\section*{Question 2}

\subsection*{Part a}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
What was see was a gas can, which exploded.

			[VP
				[NP
					[D [that]]
					[N [gas can]]
				]
				[V [explode]]
			]
		]
	]
\end{forest}

\item 
What was seen was the ability that gas has to explode

\begin{forest}
	[S
